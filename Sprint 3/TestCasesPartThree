Test Case 1: Send reminder at the correct time
Objective: Confirm that the system sends a reminder at the scheduled time and day.
Steps:
 1. Add a new user.
 2. Add medication with a specific time and day.
 3. Set the system time to match the scheduled medication time.
 4. Wait for the reminder.
Result: The system sends a reminder at the correct time and day, alerting the user to confirm whether they took the medication.

Test Case 2: Confirm medication has been taken
Objective: Ensure that the user can confirm they have taken their medication, and reminders stop afterward.
Steps:
 1. Add a new user.
 2. Add medication with a specific time and day.
 3. Set the system time to match the scheduled time for the medication.
 4. When the reminder is triggered, confirm that the medication has been taken.
Result: Once the user confirms they’ve taken the medication, the system stops sending reminders for that medication.

Test Case 3: Continue sending reminders until confirmation
Objective: Ensure that the system continues to send reminders if the user does not confirm they have taken the medication.
Steps:
 1. Add a new user.
 2. Add medication with a specific time and day.
 3. Set the system time to match the scheduled time for the medication.
 4. When the reminder is triggered, do not confirm the medication.
 5. Wait for the system to send another reminder after a set time.
Result: The system should continue sending reminders at the specified time until the user confirms that the medication has been taken.

Test Case 4: Check multiple reminders for multiple users
Objective: Verify that reminders are sent correctly for multiple users with different medication schedules.
Steps:
 1. Add two or more users.
 2. Assign different medications to each user with different times and days.
 3. Set the system time to match the scheduled times for the medications.
 4. Wait for reminders to be sent for each user.
Result: Reminders should be sent at the correct times for each user, with no overlap between users.

Test Case 5: Reminder after missed medication
Objective: Verify that the system continues to remind the user after they have missed their scheduled medication time.
Steps:
  1. Add a new user.
  2. Add medication with a specific time.
  3. Set the system time to a point after the scheduled time (e.g., 10 minutes late).
  4. Wait for the reminder.
Result: The system should send a reminder even if the medication time has passed, indicating that the user missed the scheduled time.

Test Case 6: View upcoming reminders for a user
Objective: Verify that a user can view all their upcoming reminders and scheduled medications.
Steps:
 1. Add a new user.
 2. Add multiple medications with different times and days.
 3. View the user’s upcoming medication reminders.
Result: The system should display a list of upcoming medication times and days for the user.

Test Case 7: Handle invalid time or day input for reminders
Objective: Ensure that the system handles invalid time or day input when setting reminders.
Steps:
 1. Add a new user.
 2. Try to add medication with invalid time or day inputs (e.g., "25:00 PM" or "FunDay").
 3. Check the system’s response when trying to set the reminder.
Result: The system should display an error message indicating invalid input and prevent the medication from being added until a valid time and day are provided.
