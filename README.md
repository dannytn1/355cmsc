Project Description:

The Medication Adherence System (MAS) is a tool designed to help patients stay on track with their medication schedule. It sends timely reminders and 
allows patients to log whether they have taken or missed their medication. Healthcare providers, including doctors, can review patient records to 
monitor adherence and ensure that medications are being taken as prescribed.
